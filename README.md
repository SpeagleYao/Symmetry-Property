# Symmetry Property


## Introduction

This is the open source code of a paper that has commited to CVPR2021.

---

## Our Work

In this paper, we observe symmetry property in adversarial examples.

---

## How to Use

You can run `python train_*.py` to train a specific model.

After training, you can run `python main_verify.py` to test its robustness.

Remember to change model type in `main_verify.py`.

We also provide `train.sh` and `attack.sh` to search hyper-parameters and test models automatically.
